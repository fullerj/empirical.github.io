## Abstract

The Communications-Electronics Command Software Engineering Center and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point partnered to test the feasibility of the SEC-developed mapping between Zero Trust and the Department of Defense Risk Management Framework. This effort marked the first practical exercise to gather feedback on the mappingâ€™s application and to identify adjustments needed to operationalize Zero Trust within Army environments.
