## Highlights

- Demonstrates a novel technique to inject rogue gateway controllers into Z-Wave wireless sensor networks.
- Shows the injected controller can persistently communicate with vulnerable devices even without constant Internet connectivity.
- Outlines mitigation strategies for infrastructure operators deploying Z-Wave in smart metering, home automation, and industrial environments.

## Abstract

The popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is increasing in critical infrastructure, smart metering, and home automation. Of the numerous protocols available, Z-Wave has significant potential for growth in WSNs. As a proprietary protocol, there are few research publications concerning Z-Wave, and thus little is known about the security implications of its use. Z-Wave networks use a gateway controller to manage and control all devices. Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Z-Wave gateways, all of which rely on the gateway to be consistently connected to the Internet. The work herein introduces a new vulnerability that allows the injection of a rogue controller into the network. Once injected, the rogue controller maintains a stealthy, persistent communication channel with all inadequately defended devices. The severity of this type of attack warrants mitigation steps, presented herein.
