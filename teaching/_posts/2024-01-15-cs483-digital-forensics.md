CS483 Digital Forensics introduces students to the evidence left behind when malicious activity occurs on an information system. Building on operating systems, file formats, file system structures, computer architecture, and networking, they practice disciplined investigations across end hosts and enterprise environments.

**Term:** Spring 2024

Throughout the semester students complete three self-directed projects and a series of in-class challenges that require them to acquire data, interpret artifacts, and communicate findings to technical and non-technical audiences. The capstone focus is on applying science-based methodologies across host-based forensics, malware triage, and memory analysis to detect and disrupt adversary activity.
