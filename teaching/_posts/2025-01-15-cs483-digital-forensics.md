CS483 Digital Forensics explores the evidence left behind when malicious activity occurs on an information system. Students build on earlier work in operating systems, file formats, file system structures, computer architecture, and networking to perform disciplined investigations.

**Institution:** United States Military Academy  
**Department:** Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  
**Location:** West Point, NY  
**Role:** Course Director  
**Term:** Spring 2025

The course begins with a guided review of foundational concepts, then advances into locating and extracting digital evidence. Students tackle three self-directed projects and multiple in-class challenges that require them to apply forensic techniques, communicate findings, and articulate mitigation strategies.

### Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion, students are able to:

- Apply a scientific methodology to the acquisition and analysis of digital evidence.
- Use multiple software tools to acquire and analyze digital evidence.
- Explain digital forensics concepts, results, and conclusions to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the processes and tooling required to reverse engineer malware.
- Perform memory forensics to hunt for adversary and criminal activity.
