COP 630 Cyber Law and Digital Forensics examines the U.S. and international legal frameworks that govern cyber operations and the collection of digital evidence. The course builds on COP 620 and blends legal analysis with hands-on forensic practice in a virtual lab environment.

**Institution:** University of Maryland Global Campus  
**Department:** School of Cybersecurity and Information Technology  
**Location:** Virtual  
**Role:** Course Instructor  
**Term:** Fall 2023  
**Credits:** 6

Students explore three interlocking modules:

1. **Legal Frameworks.** Study U.S. statutory and case law, international norms, and rules of engagement that shape cyber operations.
2. **Operational Compliance.** Design and defend a cyber-offense campaign that remains compliant with U.S. regulations and policy constraints.
3. **Applied Digital Forensics.** Use industry tools to acquire and analyse evidence from network captures, storage media, and RAM across common operating systems and devices.

Throughout the term, learners execute labs in a virtualized environment, document chain of custody, and deliver expert-witness style reports tying technical findings back to legal requirements.
