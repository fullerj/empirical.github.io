    "content": "Introduction ‚Äì Beheading the Hydra with Data\n\nIt was a privilege to present Spycraft 2.0: Hunting Dead Drops in Web Applications at BSidesNYC 0x05 this year. Our mission is anchored in a simple conviction: cybersecurity decisions must be informed by data, guided by research, and executed through principled leadership. Botnet takedowns have long felt like beheading a hydra‚Äîeach head removed seems to regenerate. Full visibility into command-and-control (C&amp;C) infrastructure is rare, and the time investigations require lets adversaries pivot and persist. This talk tackled a fundamental question: How can we disrupt botnets more effectively? The answer lies in weaponizing the attacker‚Äôs own logic, turning covert mechanisms into proactive defense.\n\nBackground: The Evolution of C&amp;C Evasion\n\nEarlier research showcased how reusing credentials embedded in malware could infiltrate and monitor C&amp;C infrastructure. During our Covert Infiltration and Monitoring of Command-and-Control Servers study, for instance, we reused Detplock malware‚Äôs FTP credentials to observe its controllers. Predictably, adversaries adapted by embracing a stealthier tradecraft we call Spycraft 2.0‚Äîthe use of Dead Drop Resolvers (DDRs).\n\nDDRs offer three major advantages to attackers:\n\n\n  Hiding in plain sight. DDRs lean on popular web applications‚ÄîPastebin, blockchain explorers, and more‚Äîas temporary staging grounds for C&amp;C addresses. The traffic blends in with legitimate use.\n  Unpredictable domains. With countless web apps available, adversaries gain anonymity and elasticity, hopping across seemingly random domains at will.\n  Multi-layer masking. Multi-layer encoding and encryption keeps the operational C&amp;C address hidden behind obfuscation until the right recipe is executed.\n\n\nIn practice, a DDR client pulls encoded data from a public dead drop, runs the embedded decoding routine (the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù), and then phones home to the real C&amp;C server.\n\n\n\nRazy‚Äôs DDR workflow. 1: The malware author manipulates the C&amp;C server address and posts it on X.com as a dead drop. 2: Razy executes on the victim system and fetches the dead drop. 3: Razy resolves the dead drop content to connect to the C&amp;C server.\n\nResearch Summary: From Concolic Analysis to Proactive Disruption\n\nWe flipped the script by reversing the attacker‚Äôs flow of information. DDR samples must contain the exact logic needed to decode the C&amp;C endpoint. That logic becomes the defender‚Äôs advantage.\n\nMethodology: Mapping the De-Manipulation Recipes\n\nRather than chase outbound connections, we follow the data: from fetched content to the decoded C&amp;C address. The DDR Malware Analysis Framework rests on three insights:\n\n\n  DDR logic localization. We isolate the code paths that retrieve dead drop content and process it.\n  Symbolic expression matching. The de-manipulation routines reduce to symbolic expressions. By combining concolic execution with expression matching, we identify the decoding recipe. Mudrop malware, for example, relied on Base16 decoding followed by four rotations to unmask its C&amp;C.\n  Recipe scanning. Once identified, these recipes power proactive scans of network traffic and public web apps, surfacing previously unknown dead drops.\n\n\n\nOur framework injects symbolic data (ùúÜ) to localize mudrop malware decoding logic and generate a symbolic expression (ùëÄùúÜ). This expression drives decoding algorithms to produce reference expressions under identical constraints. Our framework then compares both expressions, first structurally and then concretely via a symbolic solver, to determine functional equivalence. A high ratio of matching paths confirms equivalence.\n\nFindings: Prevalence and Preference\n\nOur analysis of 100,000 Windows samples (2012‚Äì2022) identified 8,906 DDR specimens.\n\n\n  Pastebin hosted roughly 68% of DDR malware.\n  Blockchain explorers accounted for about 25%.\n  Five of 13 dead drop services exposed crypto wallets; we uncovered 23 transaction IDs and 14 wallet IDs abused for covert signaling.\n\n\nProactively applying the recipes to packet captures revealed 72 additional dead drops across 11 web apps.\n\n\n  Base64 dominated, appearing in 40% of proactively identified recipes.\n  Other recipes blended string parsing, XOR, character rotation, and Base16 encoding.\n\n\nReal-World Impact\n\nThis methodology delivered tangible disruption:\n\n\n  88% of proactively discovered dead drops were removed in coordination with providers.\n  6,674 malware samples were neutralized, driving a 94.4% removal rate for the targeted families.\n  Recipe-driven detection increased network visibility by 57%, giving defenders the lead for once.\n\n\nKey Takeaways: Data, Research, and Principled Leadership\n\nMalware logic reuse is a powerful defensive paradigm. Intelligence starts inside the adversary‚Äôs code. Three imperatives stood out:\n\n\n  Data-driven defense. Most DDR threats lean on predictable encoding recipes. Investing in tooling that derives those recipes boosts detection by 57%.\n  Proactive remediation. By extracting the C&amp;C logic first, we pinpointed 67 C&amp;C addresses before adversaries could pivot.\n  Scalable responsibility. Empowering web application providers to identify and remove malicious dead drops early creates durable, layered defense.\n\n\nReflection and Forward Look\n\nSharing these findings with the community was energizing. Collaborative analysis of advanced tradecraft keeps collective defense moving forward. Dead Drop Resolvers represent a structural shift in C&amp;C architecture, and defenders must treat them as such.\n\nThe full paper, Enhanced Web Application Security Through Proactive Dead Drop Resolver Remediation, is now published.

These addresses are often manipulated (i.e., encoded or encrypted), rendering existing detection techniques largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce VADER, a malware forensics system specifically designed for the proactive detection of dead drops. Analyzing a dataset of 100k malware samples collected in the wild, VADER identified 8,906 DDR malware samples from 110 families that leverage 273 dead drops across seven web applications. Additionally, it proactively uncovered 57.1% more dead drops spanning 11 web applications. Case studies revealed that over 40% of DDR malware samples employ sophisticated, layered de-manipulation algorithms, highlighting the prevalence and complexity of this evasion technique. Beyond detection, VADER enabled proactive remediation by discovering 13 previously unknown dead drops from a single DDR malware sample. This approach empowers web application providers to systematically scan their platforms, enabling the early detection and mitigation of dead drops.\n\nArtifact Badges\n\n\n  Available\n  Functional\n  Reproduced\n\n\nMedia Coverage\n\n\n  Deeptempo AI - Malware‚Äôs Quiet Rendezvous\n  Georgia Tech Research - Hiding in Plain Sight\n  The Hacker News - Weekly Recap\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n@inproceedings{fuller2025vader,\n  title     = {Enhanced Web Application Security Through Proactive Dead Drop Resolver Remediation},\n  author    = {Fuller, Jonathan and Yao, Mingxuan and Agarwal, Saumya and Barua, Srimanta and Hirani, Taleb and Sikder, Amit K. and Saltaformaggio, Brendan},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)},\n  year      = {2025},\n  address   = {Taipei, Taiwan},\n}\n\n"

Seeking a covert and scalable solution, we look to an evolving pattern in modern malware that integrates standardized over-permissioned protocols, exposing privileged access to C&amp;C servers. We implement techniques to detect and exploit these protocols from over-permissioned bots toward covert C&amp;C server monitoring. Our empirical study of 200k malware captured since 2006 revealed 62,202 over-permissioned bots (nearly 1 in 3) and 443,905 C&amp;C monitoring capabilities, with a steady increase of over-permissioned protocol use over the last 15 years. Due to their ubiquity, we conclude that even though over-permissioned protocols allow for C&amp;C server infiltration, the efficiency and ease of use they provide continue to make them prevalent in the malware operational landscape. This paper presents C3PO, a pipeline that enables our study and empowers incident responders to automatically identify over-permissioned protocols, infiltration vectors to spoof bot-to-C&amp;C communication, and C&amp;C monitoring capabilities that guide covert monitoring post infiltration. Our findings suggest the over-permissioned protocol weakness provides a scalable approach to covertly monitor C&amp;C servers, which is a fundamental enabler of botnet disruptions and takedowns.\n\nBibTeX\n\n@inproceedings{fuller2021c3po,\n  title     = {C3PO: Large-Scale Study of Covert Monitoring of C\\textbackslash{}&amp;C Servers via Over-Permissioned Protocol Infiltration},\n  author    = {Fuller, Jonathan and Pai Kasturi, Ranjita and Sikder, Amit K. and Xu, Haichuan and Arik, Berat and Verma, Vivek and Asdar, Ehsan and Saltaformaggio, Brendan},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 28th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)},\n  year      = {2021},\n  address   = {Seoul, South Korea},\n}\n\n"

Although much security research into WSNs has been accomplished, researchers struggle to conduct thorough analyses of closed-source proprietary protocols. Of the numerous available and underanalyzed proprietary protocols, those based on the ITU-T G.9959 recommendation specifying narrow-band sub-GHz communications have recently experienced significant growth. The Z-Wave protocol is the most common implementation of this recommendation. Z-Wave developers are required to sign nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, limiting the availability of tools to perform open source research. Given recently demonstrated attacks against Z-Wave networks, defensive countermeasures are needed. This work extends an existing implementation of a Z-Wave Misuse-Based Intrusion Detection System (MBIDS). A side-by-side comparison is performed through experimentation to measure misuse detection accuracy of the baseline and extended MBIDS implementations. Experiment results determine the extended MBIDS achieves a mean misuse detection rate of 99%, significantly improving the security posture in MBIDS-monitored Z-Wave networks.\n\nBibTeX\n\n@article{fuller2017misusezwave,\n  title   = {Misuse-Based Detection of Z-Wave Network Attacks},\n  author  = {Fuller, Jonathan and Ramsey, Benjamin and Rice, Mason and Pecarina, John},\n  journal = {Computers &amp; Security},\n  volume  = {64},\n  pages   = {44--58},\n  month   = {January},\n  year    = {2017}\n}\n\n"

This process exploits the unique and proprietary nature of transceiver designs rather than manufacturing imperfections. To date, preamble manipulation has only successfully been demonstrated on low data rate transceivers operating in the 2.4 GHz band. This Letter investigates the effectiveness of preamble manipulation on common 5 GHz IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11ac wireless transceivers for the first time. Herein it is demonstrated that the preamble short training sequence length can be manipulated to discern among the six transceiver designs under test with greater than 99% accuracy using fewer than 20 packets.\n\nBibTeX\n\n@article{ramsey2016preamblem,\n  title   = {Efficacy of Physical Layer Preamble Manipulation for IEEE 802.11a/ac},\n  author  = {Ramsey, Benjamin and Fuller, Jonathan and Badenhop, Christopher},\n  journal = {IET Electronics Letters},\n  volume  = {52},\n  number  = {8},\n  pages   = {669--671},\n  month   = {April},\n  year    = {2016}\n}\n\n"

We exhibit how an attacker can apply information hiding as a type of covert channel attack over radio frequency transmissions into the WSN. The feasibility of our injection method is demonstrated through an attack on the most common implementation of the ITU-T G.9959 recommendation, commercially known as Z-Wave. More specifically, we illustrate that after accessing a Z-Wave gateway controller through compromising the WLAN backbone, the attacker has the ability to install malware. The malware scans incoming Z-Wave packets for information hidden in Media Access Control (MAC) frames received by the Z-Wave controller. Upon identification of hidden information, a Reverse Secure Shell is initiated through the WLAN back to the attacker. The outcomes of this attack include control of the Z-Wave network and access to the networked devices on the target WLAN from any Internet connected device. Given this new application of information hiding techniques to Z-Wave networks, we recognize the need for countermeasures. We therefore offer an effective Misuse-based Intrusion Detection System (MBIDS) capable of distinguishing between manipulated and correctly formed packets. A Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Software-Defined Radio (SDR) is used in conjunction with a packet monitoring tool capturing incoming transmissions and inspecting them for any violations of the ITU-T G.9959 MAC specification. We then analytically and experimentally estimate the efficacy of the USRP as a packet capture device in a realistic test setup, and then evaluate the total efficiency of our MBIDS solution. By employing the MBIDS in the Z-Wave network, we show the MBIDS is capable of detecting packet manipulation attacks with 92% mean accuracy.\n\nBibTeX\n\n@inproceedings{fuller2016g9959covert,\n  title     = {Wireless Intrusion Detection of Covert Channel Attacks in ITU-T G.9959-Based Networks},\n  author    = {Fuller, Jonathan and Ramsey, Benjamin and Pecarina, John and Rice, Mason},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (ICCWS)},\n  year      = {2016}\n}\n\n"

Of the numerous protocols available, Z-Wave has significant potential for growth in WSNs. As a proprietary protocol, there are few research publications concerning Z-Wave, and thus little is known about the security implications of its use. Z-Wave networks use a gateway controller to manage and control all devices. Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Z-Wave gateways, all of which rely on the gateway to be consistently connected to the Internet. The work herein introduces a new vulnerability that allows the injection of a rogue controller into the network. Once injected, the rogue controller maintains a stealthy, persistent communication channel with all inadequately defended devices. The severity of this type of attack warrants mitigation steps, presented herein.\n\nBibTeX\n\n@inproceedings{fuller2015roguezwave,\n  title     = {Rogue Z-Wave Controllers: A Persistent Attack Channel},\n  author    = {Fuller, Jonathan and Ramsey, Benjamin},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE 40th Local Computer Networks Conference Workshops (LCN Workshops)},\n  year      = {2015},\n  month     = {October},\n  address   = {Clearwater Beach, FL},\n  publisher = {IEEE}\n}\n\n"

However, evaluating the robustness and security of commercially-available products based on this standard is challenging due to the closed-source nature of the transceiver and application designs. Given that ITU-T G.9959 transceivers are being used in smart grids, building security systems and safety sensors, the development of reliable, open-source tools would enhance the ability to monitor and secure ITU-T G.9959 networks. This chapter discusses the ITU-T G.9959 wireless standard and research on ITU-T G.9959 network security. An open-source, software-defined radio implementation of an ITU-T G.9959 protocol sniffer is used to explore several passive reconnaissance techniques and deduce the properties of active network devices. The experimental results show that some properties are observable regardless of whether or not encryption is used. In particular, the acknowledgment response times vary due to differences in vendor firmware implementations.\n\nBibTeX\n\n@incollection{badenhop2015evaluatingg9959,\n  title     = {Evaluating ITU-T G.9959 Based Wireless Systems Used in Critical Infrastructure Assets},\n  author    = {Badenhop, Christopher and Fuller, Jonathan and Hall, Joseph and Ramsey, Benjamin and Rice, Mason},\n  booktitle = {Critical Infrastructure Protection IX},\n  series    = {IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology},\n  year      = {2015}\n}\n\n"
