<p>It was a privilege to present <strong>Spycraft 2.0: Hunting Dead Drops in Web Applications</strong> at BSidesNYC 0x05 this year. Our mission is anchored in a simple conviction: cybersecurity decisions must be informed by data, guided by research, and executed through principled leadership. Botnet takedowns have long felt like beheading a hydra‚Äîeach head removed seems to regenerate. Full visibility into command-and-control (C&amp;C) infrastructure is rare, and the time investigations require lets adversaries pivot and persist. This talk tackled a fundamental question: <em>How can we disrupt botnets more effectively?</em> The answer lies in weaponizing the attacker‚Äôs own logic, turning covert mechanisms into proactive defense.</p>

<p><strong>Background: The Evolution of C&amp;C Evasion</strong></p>

<p>Earlier research showcased how reusing credentials embedded in malware could infiltrate and monitor C&amp;C infrastructure. During our <strong>Covert Infiltration and Monitoring of Command-and-Control Servers</strong> study, for instance, we reused Detplock malware‚Äôs FTP credentials to observe its controllers. Predictably, adversaries adapted by embracing a stealthier tradecraft we call <strong>Spycraft 2.0</strong>‚Äîthe use of <strong>Dead Drop Resolvers (DDRs)</strong>.</p>

<p>DDRs offer three major advantages to attackers:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Hiding in plain sight.</strong> DDRs lean on popular web applications‚ÄîPastebin, blockchain explorers, and more‚Äîas temporary staging grounds for C&amp;C addresses. The traffic blends in with legitimate use.</li>
  <li><strong>Unpredictable domains.</strong> With countless web apps available, adversaries gain anonymity and elasticity, hopping across seemingly random domains at will.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-layer masking.</strong> Multi-layer encoding and encryption keeps the operational C&amp;C address hidden behind obfuscation until the right recipe is executed.</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, a DDR client pulls encoded data from a public dead drop, runs the embedded decoding routine (the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù), and then phones home to the real C&amp;C server.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blogs/spycraft/ddr.jpg" alt="Illustrative dead drop resolver workflow" class="img-framed" width="70%" /></p>

<p class="figcaption">Razy‚Äôs DDR workflow. 1: The malware author manipulates the C&amp;C server address and posts it on X.com as a dead drop. 2: Razy executes on the victim system and fetches the dead drop. 3: Razy resolves the dead drop content to connect to the C&amp;C server.</p>

<p><strong>Research Summary: From Concolic Analysis to Proactive Disruption</strong></p>

<p>We flipped the script by reversing the attacker‚Äôs flow of information. DDR samples must contain the exact logic needed to decode the C&amp;C endpoint. That logic becomes the defender‚Äôs advantage.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology: Mapping the De-Manipulation Recipes</strong></p>

<p>Rather than chase outbound connections, we follow the data: from fetched content to the decoded C&amp;C address. The DDR Malware Analysis Framework rests on three insights:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>DDR logic localization.</strong> We isolate the code paths that retrieve dead drop content and process it.</li>
  <li><strong>Symbolic expression matching.</strong> The de-manipulation routines reduce to symbolic expressions. By combining concolic execution with expression matching, we identify the decoding recipe. Mudrop malware, for example, relied on Base16 decoding followed by four rotations to unmask its C&amp;C.</li>
  <li><strong>Recipe scanning.</strong> Once identified, these recipes power proactive scans of network traffic and public web apps, surfacing previously unknown dead drops.</li>
</ol>

<p class="figcaption"><img src="/assets/blogs/spycraft/symbex.jpg" alt="Symbolic Expression Matching" class="img-framed" width="50%" />
Our framework injects symbolic data (ùúÜ) to localize mudrop malware decoding logic and generate a symbolic expression (ùëÄùúÜ). This expression drives decoding algorithms to produce reference expressions under identical constraints. Our framework then compares both expressions, first structurally and then concretely via a symbolic solver, to determine functional equivalence. A high ratio of matching paths confirms equivalence.</p>

<p><strong>Findings: Prevalence and Preference</strong></p>

<p>Our analysis of 100,000 Windows samples (2012‚Äì2022) identified <strong>8,906</strong> DDR specimens.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pastebin</strong> hosted roughly <strong>68%</strong> of DDR malware.</li>
  <li><strong>Blockchain explorers</strong> accounted for about <strong>25%</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Five of 13</strong> dead drop services exposed crypto wallets; we uncovered <strong>23 transaction IDs</strong> and <strong>14 wallet IDs</strong> abused for covert signaling.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proactively applying the recipes to packet captures revealed <strong>72 additional dead drops</strong> across <strong>11</strong> web apps.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Base64</strong> dominated, appearing in <strong>40%</strong> of proactively identified recipes.</li>
  <li>Other recipes blended string parsing, XOR, character rotation, and Base16 encoding.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real-World Impact</strong></p>

<p>This methodology delivered tangible disruption:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>88%</strong> of proactively discovered dead drops were removed in coordination with providers.</li>
  <li><strong>6,674</strong> malware samples were neutralized, driving a <strong>94.4%</strong> removal rate for the targeted families.</li>
  <li>Recipe-driven detection increased network visibility by <strong>57%</strong>, giving defenders the lead for once.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways: Data, Research, and Principled Leadership</strong></p>

<p>Malware logic reuse is a powerful defensive paradigm. Intelligence starts inside the adversary‚Äôs code. Three imperatives stood out:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data-driven defense.</strong> Most DDR threats lean on predictable encoding recipes. Investing in tooling that derives those recipes boosts detection by 57%.</li>
  <li><strong>Proactive remediation.</strong> By extracting the C&amp;C logic first, we pinpointed <strong>67 C&amp;C addresses</strong> before adversaries could pivot.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable responsibility.</strong> Empowering web application providers to identify and remove malicious dead drops early creates durable, layered defense.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Reflection and Forward Look</strong></p>

<p>Sharing these findings with the community was energizing. Collaborative analysis of advanced tradecraft keeps collective defense moving forward. Dead Drop Resolvers represent a structural shift in C&amp;C architecture, and defenders must treat them as such.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Dead Drop Resolver (DDR) malware evades traditional Command and Control (C&amp;C) server takedowns by dynamically resolving C&amp;C addresses hosted on popular web applications, such as Dropbox and Pastebin. These addresses are often manipulated (i.e., encoded or encrypted), rendering existing detection techniques largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce VADER, a malware forensics system specifically designed for the proactive detection of dead drops. Analyzing a dataset of 100k malware samples collected in the wild, VADER identified 8,906 DDR malware samples from 110 families that leverage 273 dead drops across seven web applications. Additionally, it proactively uncovered 57.1% more dead drops spanning 11 web applications. Case studies revealed that over 40% of DDR malware samples employ sophisticated, layered de-manipulation algorithms, highlighting the prevalence and complexity of this evasion technique. Beyond detection, VADER enabled proactive remediation by discovering 13 previously unknown dead drops from a single DDR malware sample. This approach empowers web application providers to systematically scan their platforms, enabling the early detection and mitigation of dead drops.</p>

<p>Web applications provide a wide array of utilities that are abused by malware as a replacement for traditional attacker-controlled servers. Thwarting these Web App-Engaged (WAE) malware requires rapid collaboration between incident responders and web app providers. Unfortunately, our research found that delays in this collaboration allow WAE malware to thrive. We developed Marsea, an automated malware analysis pipeline that studies WAE malware and enables rapid remediation. Given 10K malware samples, Marsea revealed 893 WAE malware in 97 families abusing 29 web apps. Our research uncovered a 226% increase in the number of WAE malware since 2020 and that malware authors are beginning to reduce their reliance on attacker-controlled servers. In fact, we found a 13.7% decrease in WAE malware relying on attacker-controlled servers. To date, we have used Marsea to collaborate with the web app providers to take down 50% of the malicious web app content.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Modern websites owe most of their aesthetics and functionalities to Content Management Systems (CMS) plugins, which are bought and sold on widely popular marketplaces. Driven by economic incentives, attackers abuse the trust in this economy: selling malware on legitimate marketplaces, pirating popular plugins, and infecting plugins post-deployment. This research studied the evolution of CMS plugins in over 400K production webservers dating back to 2012. We developed YODA, an automated framework to detect malicious plugins and track down their origin. YODA uncovered 47,337 malicious plugins on 24,931 unique websites. Among these, $41.5K had been spent on 3,685 malicious plugins sold on legitimate plugin marketplaces. Pirated plugins cheated developers out of $228K in revenues. Post-deployment attacks infected $834K worth of previously benign plugins with malware. Lastly, YODA informs our remediation efforts, as over 94% of these malicious plugins are still active today.</p>
