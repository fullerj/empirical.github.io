# EmpiricalDefense Website

EmpiricalDefense is a personal brand site built with Jekyll and the Hydejack theme. The repository tracks the content, configuration, and styling used on <https://empiricaldefense.com> (local preview available at <http://localhost:4000/> when running the development server).

---

## Requirements

These steps mirror the working macOS setup. Adapt as needed for Linux or Windows:

1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools (if missing):
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. Optionally install Homebrew (<https://brew.sh/>) to simplify package management.
3. Install `rbenv` and Ruby build tooling:
   ```bash
   brew install rbenv ruby-build
   ```
4. Initialise `rbenv` for zsh (run once, then restart your shell):
   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
   exec zsh
   ```

---

## First-time Setup

From the project root (`/Users/jon/Repositories/empirical.github.io`):

```bash
# Install and select the Ruby version used by the site
rbenv install 3.2.3
rbenv local 3.2.3
rbenv rehash
ruby -v

# Install the Bundler version locked in Gemfile.lock
gem install bundler:2.2.3
rbenv rehash

# Install gems locally in vendor/bundle
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle _2.2.3_ install

# Run the development server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:4000/> to preview the site. Jekyll rebuilds automatically when files change.

## Project Structure

Key paths and how they are used:

| Area | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage | `index.html` | Uses the `about` layout and renders the full content of `about.md`. Any updates to About automatically appear on the landing page. |
| About | `about.md` | Primary biography plus education, certifications, highlights, and table of contents. |
| Service | `service.md` | Volunteer, reviewer, and outreach activities. Linked from the sidebar navigation. |
| Blog | `blog/_posts/` | Markdown files with `categories: [posts]` appear on `/blog/` and in “Recent Insights.” |
| Publications | `publications/_posts/` | Each publication entry includes optional metadata (`conference`, `pdf_url`, etc.). Use `2025-10-13-vader.md` as a template. |
| Teaching | `teaching/_posts/` | Teaching history. Cards feed the Teaching page, and education details live on the About page. |
| Talks | `_data/talks.yml` | YAML list of talks rendered by `talks.md`. Entries support title, event, location, date, and optional description/resources. |
| Search | `search.md`, `search.json`, `assets/js/simple-jekyll-search.min.js` | Implements client-side search against posts via Simple-Jekyll-Search. |
| Navigation | `_config.yml` (`menu:`) | Sidebar links (Blog, Publications, Talks, Teaching, Service, About). |
| Styling | `_sass/my-style.scss`, `_sass/home.scss` | Custom SCSS for cards, dark mode tweaks, homepage spacing, etc. |
| Branding | `assets/img/…` | Logos for institutions, certifications, and the accent image (`accent_image` in `_config.yml`). |

## Content Guidelines

### Publications
- Store PDFs in `assets/papers/` and link with absolute paths (e.g., `/assets/papers/ccs25.pdf`).
- Include `venue` to add a bracketed label on the index (e.g., `[ACM CCS]`).
- Optional arrays: `media_links`, `artifact_badges`, `tags`.

### Teaching & Education
- Teaching posts (`teaching/_posts/*.md`) appear under `/teaching/` and feed the About-page highlights.
- Education cards on About are hard-coded with logos and details. Update the HTML fragment in `about.md` when degrees change.

### Service
- Service content is written directly in `service.md`. Add new volunteer or committee roles by editing the appropriate sections.

### Search
- `search.json` is populated at build time using Liquid. Rebuild the site to refresh the index after adding posts.
- The `/search/` page uses Simple-Jekyll-Search to query the JSON index in the browser.

## Deployment Notes

- The `_site/` folder is generated by `bundle exec jekyll build` or `jekyll serve`. Deploy that directory (or activate GitHub Pages / Netlify) to publish updates.
- Update DNS records (CNAME or A records) once hosting is configured for your custom domain.
- Remove or adjust pagination settings in `_config.yml` if you are not using Hydejack’s blog pagination (currently disabled).

Feel free to extend this README with host-specific instructions, automation scripts, or content workflows as EmpiricalDefense grows.
